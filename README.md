This was not created by me, it was created by Martin Aspeli (https://github.com/optilude) and came from this forum thread: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2738

I'm hosting this repository to keep it updated for Sublime Text 3 and also to add it to Package Control (because everyone should have access to such an awesome plugin).
